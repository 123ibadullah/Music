## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Will my local setup still work?**
A: Yes! All changes are production-focused. Local development unchanged.

**Q: What if I get CORS errors?**
A: Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Backend/.env with your frontend URLs.

**Q: Do I need to change anything in the code?**
A: No! Just deploy as-is and update environment variables.

**Q: Which hosting platform should I use?**
A: Vercel is easiest and free. Railway is better for backend if you need persistent connections.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! All security features are active, and credentials are in .env (not committed to Git).
