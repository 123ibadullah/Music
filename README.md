## 🔧 **Backend Explanation**

### **What the Backend Does:**
The backend is the "brain" of your application. It handles all the data processing, user authentication, and serves information to the frontend.

### **Key Components:**

#### **1. Database Models (MongoDB Schemas)**
```javascript
// User Model - Stores user information
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (encrypted),
  likedSongs: [Song IDs],
  recentlyPlayed: [{song: Song ID, playedAt: Date}]
}

// Song Model - Stores music information
{
  name: String,
  desc: String,
  album: String,
  image: String (Cloudinary URL),
  file: String (Cloudinary URL),
  duration: String,
  createdAt: Date
}

// Album Model - Groups songs together
{
  name: String,
  desc: String,
  image: String (Cloudinary URL),
  bgColor: String,
  createdAt: Date
}

// Playlist Model - User-created song collections
{
  name: String,
  description: String,
  user: User ID (owner),
  songs: [Song IDs],
  createdAt: Date
}
```

#### **2. API Routes (Endpoints)**
The backend provides these main API endpoints:

**Authentication Routes:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user information
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile

**Song Routes:**
- `GET /api/song/list` - Get all songs
- `POST /api/song/add` - Add new song (Admin only)
- `POST /api/song/like` - Like a song
- `POST /api/song/unlike` - Unlike a song
- `GET /api/song/liked` - Get user's liked songs
- `POST /api/song/recently-played` - Add song to recently played
- `GET /api/song/recently-played` - Get recently played songs

**Album Routes:**
- `GET /api/album/list` - Get all albums
- `POST /api/album/add` - Add new album (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/album/:id` - Update album (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/album/:id` - Delete album (Admin only)

**Playlist Routes (Authentication Required):**
- `GET /api/playlist/list` - Get user's playlists
- `GET /api/playlist/:id` - Get specific playlist (owner only)
- `POST /api/playlist/create` - Create new playlist
- `POST /api/playlist/add-song` - Add song to playlist (owner only)
- `POST /api/playlist/remove-song` - Remove song from playlist (owner only)
- `DELETE /api/playlist/delete/:id` - Delete playlist (owner only)

#### **3. Authentication System**
- Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt
- Protected routes require valid JWT tokens
- User sessions persist across browser refreshes

#### **4. File Upload System**
- Uses Multer middleware for handling file uploads
- Integrates with Cloudinary for cloud storage
- Supports image uploads (album covers) and audio files
- Automatic file optimization and CDN delivery

## 🎨 **Frontend Explanation**

### **What the Frontend Does:**
The frontend is what users see and interact with. It's built with React and provides a modern, responsive interface for music streaming.

### **Key Components:**

#### **1. Context Providers (State Management)**
```javascript
// AuthContext - Manages user authentication state
- isAuthenticated: boolean
- user: user object
- login: function
- logout: function

// PlayerContext - Manages music player state
- track: current playing song
- playStatus: playing/paused
- songsData: all songs
